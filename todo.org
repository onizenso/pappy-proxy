#+STARTUP: indent

* currently working on
** Polish http.Request/Response to a shine to get ready for scripting
* todo list
** TODO For multipart forms, make sure metadata lines end in \r\n

* Important features
** TODO Easy session handling and switching
- Option to create session from request
- By default put session in foreground and end it by hitting enter, have option to background it
- Can't edit contacts

* Random, easy to implement features
** DONE "lite" mode
- Don't make files in current directory
- Use default config
- Use sqlite db in /tmp, delete when quitting
** DONE Request.url setter/getter
- Request.url = 'https://www.google.com'
** TODO Inline decoders/encoders
- optionally go straight to/from clipboard
** TODO Add id aliases and have "load_request/load_response" handle it transparently
- ie map r1 to 123
- Could be temporary or stored in db?
- Or we could give requests that we want to last for the session an id
  - then load_from_request can check that session-long id in memory and return it without touching the db
- Make the context sort by time
** DONE Use pygments to add syntax hilighting to printing requests
- And option to not do it
** TODO Compare mode
- Pick any number of requests (usually 2) and look at them all at the same time in vim

** DONE Change rsp len from None to N/A
** DONE Honor $EDITOR for interceptor
** DONE Make it easier to quit interceptor after a request
** TODO Let interceptor take filter string
* Performance
** TODO Have context keep a max number of requests in memory at a time
- Then if ls needs more, have it load that many then prune again
- Could maybe somehow do it by request size

* Tracking github
  git checkout --track -b gh github/master
